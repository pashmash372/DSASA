Problem Description
Given a number A, check if it is a magic number or not.

A number is said to be a magic number if the sum of its digits is calculated till a single digit recursively by adding the sum of the digits after every addition. If the single digit comes out to be 1, then the number is a magic number.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109



Input Format
The first and only argument is an integer A.



Output Format
Return an 1 if the given number is magic else return 0.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 83557
Input 2:

 A = 1291


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Sum of digits of (83557) = 28
 Sum of digits of (28) = 10
 Sum of digits of (10) = 1.
 Single digit is 1, so it's a magic number. Return 1.
Explanation 2:

 Sum of digits of (1291) = 13
 Sum of digits of (13) = 4
 Single digit is not 1, so it's not a magic number. Return 0.

/*One approach is to recursively check the sum of digits until a single digit is left.
Now, check if the number is 1, then it is a magic number. Else NOT.

Efficient Approach:

There is also a shortcut method to verify Magic Number.
The function will determine if the remainder of dividing the input by 9 is 1 or not.
If it is 1, then the number is a magic number.
The divisibility rule of 9 says that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9.
Therefore, if a number is divisible by 9, then, recursively, all the digit sums are also divisible by 9.
The final digit sum is always 9. An increase of 1 in the original number will increase the ultimate value by 1, making it 10, and the ultimate sum will be 1, thus verifying that it is a magic number.*/
