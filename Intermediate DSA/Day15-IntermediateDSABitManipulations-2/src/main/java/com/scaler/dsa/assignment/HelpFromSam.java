/*Q1. Help From Sam

Get help from TA.
Problem Description
Alex and Sam are good friends. Alex is doing a lot of programming these days. He has set a target score of A for himself.
Initially, Alex's score was zero. Alex can double his score by doing a question, or Alex can seek help from Sam for doing questions that will contribute 1 to Alex's score. Alex wants his score to be precisely A. Also, he does not want to take much help from Sam.

Find and return the minimum number of times Alex needs to take help from Sam to achieve a score of A.


Problem Constraints
0 <= A <= 10^9


Input Format
The only argument given is an integer A.


Output Format
Return the minimum number of times help taken from Sam.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = 5
Input 2:

A = 3


Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:

2


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Initial score : 0
Takes help from Sam, score : 1
Alex solves a question, score : 2
Alex solves a question, score : 4
Takes help from Sam, score: 5
Explanation 2:

Initial score : 0
Takes help from Sam, score : 1
Alex solves a question, score : 2
Takes help from Sam, score : 3

Solution Approach
Claim :The number of times we would require help from sam is the number of bits that are set in A.

Lets try to build an intuition for this. Instead of going from 0 to A , we will go in the reverse direction i.e. from A to 0.
First initialise a cnt variable to 0 which is the number of times we took help from sam.Now we would follow this approach until A becomes 0.

If A is an even number we can divide it by 2
otherwise if A is an odd number we can subtract 1 from it and increment the cnt.

Since every time we divide by 2 if its an even number , it is same as doing a left shift. The number of times A would become odd is the number of set bits of A.

Lets take an example to make this more clear:

A=17
0) 17 ,cnt=0
1) 17 -> 16 , cnt=1
2) 16 -> 8 , cnt=1
3) 8 -> 4 , cnt=1
4) 4 -> 2 , cnt=1
5) 2 -> 1 , cnt=1
6) 1 -> 0 , cnt=2

binary representation of 17 = 10001 , and we can see that the number of set bits is the same as cnt that we obtained in the above approach.

Therefore it is enough to just find the number of set bits of A.

We can do this as follows:

cnt=0
for i from 0 to 31
    if A&(1<<i) != 0
        cnt++
return cnt
