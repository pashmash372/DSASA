Problem Description
You are given an integer array A of length N.
You have to find the sum of all subarray sums of A.
More formally, a subarray is defined as a contiguous part of an array which we can obtain by deleting zero or more elements from either end of the array.
A subarray sum denotes the sum of all the elements of that subarray.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 10 4


Input Format
The first argument is the integer array A.


Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the sum of all subarray sums of the given array.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 3]
Input 2:

A = [2, 1, 3]


Example Output
Output 1:
20
Output 2:

19


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
The different subarrays for the given array are: [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3].
Their sums are: 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 20
Explanation 2:

Similiar to the first example, the sum of all subarray sums for this array is 19.*/


/*For each element, if we know how many subarrays do they come in,
we can easily calculate their contribution to the sum as (Number of Subarrays) * (A[i]).

How do we calculate the number of subarrays for each element?
Let us focus on the definition of a subarray. It is obtained by deleting zero or more elements from either end.
So, for each element, let X be the number of elements to their left, and Y be the number of elements to their right.
Number of required subarrays = (X + 1) * (Y + 1)

We can easily know X and Y from the index of the element.
Let the array be 0 - indexed and N be the length of the array,
X = i, Y = N - i - 1

Refer to the complete solution for implementation details.*/
