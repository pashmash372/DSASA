Get help from TA.
Problem Description

Little Ponny has been given a string A, and he wants to find out the lexicographically minimum subsequence from it of size >= 2. Can you help him?

A string a is lexicographically smaller than string b, if the first different letter in a and b is smaller in a. For example, "abc" is lexicographically smaller than "acc" because the first different letter is 'b' and 'c' which is smaller in "abc".





Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 105

A only contains lowercase alphabets.



Input Format

The first and the only argument of input contains the string, A.



Output Format

Return a string representing the answer.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = "abcdsfhjagj"
Input 2:

 A = "ksdjgha"


Example Output

Output 1:

 "aa"
Output 2:

 "da"


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 "aa" is the lexicographically minimum subsequence from A.
Explanation 2:

 "da" is the lexicographically minimum subsequence from A.

/*The last character of A cannot be a part of the first character of the answer, so we donâ€™t consider it.

We can pick up the first occurrence of the smallest character in the rest of the string.

Now, all of the string lying before the occurrence of the first character is useless. So, we can exclude the whole string behind it and only consider the string after it.

We can pick the smallest character in the leftover substring.*/
