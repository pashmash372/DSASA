Problem Description
Given an integer A.
Two numbers, X and Y, are defined as follows:

X is the greatest number smaller than A such that the XOR sum of X and A is the same as the sum of X and A.
Y is the smallest number greater than A, such that the XOR sum of Y and A is the same as the sum of Y and A.
Find and return the XOR of X and Y.

NOTE 1: XOR of X and Y is defined as X ^ Y where '^' is the BITWISE XOR operator.

NOTE 2: Your code will be run against a maximum of 100000 Test Cases.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109



Input Format
First and only argument is an integer A.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the XOR of X and Y.



Example Input
A = 5


Example Output
10


Example Explanation
The value of X will be 2 and the value of Y will be 8. The XOR of 2 and 8 is 10.

/*Following the above equation, if xor sum and the sum of 2 numbers are equal, their bitwise AND should be zero.
Given a number N, how to find a number whose bitwise AND with N is 0?
Keeping in mind the truth table of AND, 1 & 1 = 1 while 1 & 0 = 0, 0 & 1 = 0 and 0 & 0 = 0.
Therefore, in the number X such that X & N is 0, all the set bits of number N must be unset in the number X since 1 & 0 = 0.
The unset bits of N can have any orientation in X, that is, they can either be 0 or be 1.
So to find the smallest number greater than N, the answer is the next power of 2 greater than N. Think why!!
And to find the greatest number smaller than N, set all the unset bits of N to 1.*/
