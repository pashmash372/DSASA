Problem Description
Given an integer array A of N integers, find the pair of integers in the array which have minimum XOR value. Report the minimum XOR value.



Problem Constraints
2 <= length of the array <= 100000
0 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
First and only argument of input contains an integer array A.



Output Format
Return a single integer denoting minimum xor value.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [0, 2, 5, 7]
Input 2:

 A = [0, 4, 7, 9]


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 3


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 0 xor 2 = 2*/


/*The first step is to sort the array. The answer will be the minimum value of X[i] XOR X[i+1] for every i.

Proof:
Letâ€™s suppose that the answer is not X[i] XOR X[i+1], but A XOR B and there exists C in the array such as A <= C <= B.

Next is the proof that either A XOR C or C XOR B is smaller than A XOR B.

Let A[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of A
Let B[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of B
Let C[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of C

This is with the assumption that all of A, B and C are padded with 0 on the left until they all have the same length

Example: A = 169, B = 187, C = 185

A = 101010012
B = 101110112
C = 101110012

Let i be the leftmost (biggest) index such that A[i] differs from B[i]. There are 2 cases now:
1) C[i] = A[i] = 0,
then (A XOR C)[i] = 0 and (A XOR B)[i] = 1
This implies (A XOR C) < (A XOR B)
2) C[i] = B[i] = 1,
then (B XOR C)[i] = 0 and (A XOR B)[i] = 1
This implies (B XOR C) < (A XOR B)

Time complexity: O(N * logN) to sort the array and O(N) to find the smallest XOR
Space complexity: O(N)*/
