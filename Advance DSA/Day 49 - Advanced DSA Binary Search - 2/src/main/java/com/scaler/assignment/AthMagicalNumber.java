/*Say L = lcm(B, C), the least common multiple of B and C, and let f(x) be the number of magical numbers less than or equal to x.
A well known result says that L = (B*C)/gcd(B,C), and that we can calculate the function gcd.

Then f(x) = x/B + x/C - x/L (floor of all the divisions)

Why? There are x/B numbers B, 2B, 3Bâ€¦. that are divisible by B, there are x/C numbers divisible by C, and we need to subtract the x/L numbers divisible by B and C that we double-counted.

Finally,the answer must be between 0 and A * min(B,C).

If x increases f(x) increases, we can use binary search on x to find the Ath number.

Algorithm:
1) Low=1 and High = A * min(B,C)
2) Find mid = (low + high)/2
3) Find f(mid) let it be count
4) If count>=A then mark it as a answer and try to find smaller number which implies high = mid-1
5) Else low = mid+1
6) Repeat steps 2 to 5 until low<=high

Time Complexity: O(log (A * min(B, C)))
Space Complexity: O(1).
