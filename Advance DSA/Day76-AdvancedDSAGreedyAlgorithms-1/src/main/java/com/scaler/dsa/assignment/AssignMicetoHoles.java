Get help from TA.
Problem Description
N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accommodate only one mouse.

The positions of Mice are denoted by array A, and the position of holes is denoted by array B.

A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consume 1 minute.

Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105

-109 <= A[i], B[i] <= 109



Input Format
The first argument is an integer array A.

The second argument is an integer array B.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the minimum time when the last nouse gets inside the holes.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [-4, 2, 3]
 B = [0, -2, 4]
Input 2:

 A = [-2]
 B = [-6]


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 4


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Assign the mouse at position (-4 to -2), (2 to 0) and (3 to 4).
 The number of moves required will be 2, 2 and 1 respectively.
 So, the time taken will be 2.
Explanation 2:

 Assign the mouse at position -2 to -6.
 The number of moves required will be 4.
 So, the time taken will be 4.*/

/*Approach:

sort mice positions (in any order)
sort hole positions

Loop i = 1 to N:
    update ans according to the value of |mice(i) - hole(i)|

Proof of correctness:

Let i1 < i2 be the positions of two mice and let j1 < j2 be the positions of two holes.
It suffices to show via case analysis that.

max(|i1 - j1|, |i2 - j2|) <= max(|i1 - j2|, |i2 - j1|) ,
    where '|a - b|' represent absolute value of (a - b)
since it follows by induction that every assignment can be transformed by a series of swaps into the sorted assignment, where none of these swaps increases the makespan.*/
