/*The concept behind this:

    Fermat theory -
    a^(p-1)%p = 1, where p is a prime no.
    so try to try to write a^(b!) % m in above form.
    b! can be written as-
    b! = n(p-1) + x;  // x is a reminder

    a^(b!) % m =[ a^(p-1) +a^(p-1) +a^(p-1) +a^(p-1) +a^(p-1) +a^(p-1)  + … + a^x ] % m
    now all will become 1 except the last, so it becomes</span>

    a^(b!) % m = a^x % m

    now, x = b! - n(p-1)
    x is nothing but the remainder after continuous subtraction, which is nothing but modulus.
    therefore, x = b! % (p-1)
    so finally we want a^x % m, where x = b! % (p-1)

Problem Description
Given two Integers A, B. You have to calculate (A ^ (B!)) % (1e9 + 7).

"^" means power,

"%" means "mod", and

"!" means factorial.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A, B <= 5e5



Input Format
First argument is the integer A

Second argument is the integer B



Output Format
Return one integer, the answer to the problem



Example Input
Input 1:

A = 1
B = 1
Input 2:

A = 2
B = 2


Example Output
Output 1:

1
Output 2:

4


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 1! = 1. Hence 1^1 = 1.
Explanation 2:

 2! = 2. Hence 2^2 = 4.

/*This problem is very simple if you know Fermat’s Little Theorem.

The basic approach to solve this problem is to find factorial of B by taking mod with (P-1), where P is a prime. In this problem, 10007 is also a prime.

After calculating the factorial of B, you can calculate A ^ B! by simply taking mod with P.*/
