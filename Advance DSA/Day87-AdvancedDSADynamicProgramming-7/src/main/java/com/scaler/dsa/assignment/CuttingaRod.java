Problem Description
Given a rod of length N units and an array A of size N denotes prices that contains prices of all pieces of size 1 to N.

Find and return the maximum value that can be obtained by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000

0 <= A[i] <= 106



Input Format
First and only argument is an integer array A of size N.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximum value that can be obtained by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [3, 4, 1, 6, 2]
Input 2:

 A = [1, 5, 2, 5, 6]


Example Output
Output 1:

 15
Output 2:

 11


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Cut the rod of length 5 into 5 rods of length (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) and sell them for (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3) = 15.
Explanation 2:

 Cut the rod of length 5 into 3 rods of length (2, 2, 1) and sell them for (5 + 5 + 1) = 11.
*/

/*For the naive solution, We can get the best price by making a cut at different positions and comparing the values obtained after a cut.
We can recursively call the same function for a piece obtained after a cut.

Letâ€™s optimize it.

Consider val[i] denotes the maximum price we can get by selling the rod (can sell by cutting any how) of length i.
->for all j from 0 to i-1, val[i] = max(val[i],A[j] + val[i-j-1]).

val[n] will be the output.*/
