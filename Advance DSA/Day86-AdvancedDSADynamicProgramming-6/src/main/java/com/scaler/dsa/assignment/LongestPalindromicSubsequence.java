Problem Description
Given a string A. Find the longest palindromic subsequence (A subsequence which does not need to be contiguous and is a palindrome).

You need to return the length of longest palindromic subsequence.



Problem Constraints
1 <= length of(A) <= 103



Input Format
First and only integer is a string A.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the length of longest palindromic subsequence.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "bebeeed"
Input 2:

 A = "aedsead"


Example Output
Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 5


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The longest palindromic subsequence is "eeee", which has a length of 4.
Explanation 2:

 The longest palindromic subsequence is "aedea", which has a length of 5.

/*First, Create a recurrence relation then we will think of optimizing that.
Letâ€™s say for sequence A[0..n-1] , L(0,n-1) denotes the length of longest palidromic subsequence.
It will be calculated by:
-> If last and first character of the sequence are same, then L(0,n-1) = L(1,n-1) + 2
->Else, L(0,n-1) = max(L(0,n-2),L(1,n-1))

Since we can observe overlapping Subproblems, we will optimize it using a dynamic programming solution.*/
