Problem Description
Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M and an integer B. Write an efficient algorithm that searches for integer B in matrix A.

This matrix A has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than or equal to the last integer of the previous row.
Return 1 if B is present in A, else return 0.

NOTE: Rows are numbered from top to bottom, and columns are from left to right.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 1000
1 <= A[i][j], B <= 106



Input Format
The first argument given is the integer matrix A.
The second argument given is the integer B.



Output Format
Return 1 if B is present in A else, return 0.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [
      [1,   3,  5,  7]
      [10, 11, 16, 20]
      [23, 30, 34, 50]
    ]
B = 3
Input 2:

A = [
      [5, 17, 100, 111]
      [119, 120, 127, 131]
    ]
B = 3


Example Output
Output 1:

1
Output 2:

0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 3 is present in the matrix at A[0][1] position so return 1.
Explanation 2:

 3 is not present in the matrix so return 0.*/

/*If you write down the numbers of row 1 followed by numbers in row2, row3, and so on, do you think the resulting array would be sorted?

If yes, how do you search for a number efficiently in a sorted array?

Just think of how the index in the array can be translated to the elements in the matrix.
For eg: Total elements : mn; m = no of rows; n = no of columns.
Indexing will go from 0 to mn - 1. Since the matrix is sorted, binary search can be applied here.
We take the mid of the total search space (initially all elements), then translate it to the indexes in the matrix
by row = int(mid / n) and col = int(mid % n). This is valid because every row contains n elements.*/
